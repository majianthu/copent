# copent
R package for Estimating Copula Entropy

#### Introduction
Copula Entropy is a mathematical concept for statistical independence measurement [1]. In bivariate case, Copula Entropy is proved to be equivalent to Mutual Information. Different from Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Copula Entropy is defined for non-linear, high-order and multivariate cases, which makes it universally applicable.

It enjoys wide applications, including but not limited toï¼š

* Structure Learning;

* Variable Selection [2];

* Causal Discovery (Estimating Transfer Entropy) [3].

This algorithm composes of two steps: estimating empirical copula density with rank statistics and estimating copula entropy from the estimated empirical copula density with kNN method. Since both steps are with non-parametric methods, the copent algorithm can be applied to any cases without making assumptions.

For more information, please refer to [1-3]. For more information in Chinese, please follow [this link](http://blog.sciencenet.cn/blog-3018268-978326.html).

#### Functions
* copent -- main function;

* construct_empirical_copula -- the first step of the algorithm, which estimates empirical copula for data by rank statistics;

* entknn -- the second step of the algorithm, which estimates copula entropy from empirical copula with kNN method.

#### Usage 
##### Install the package
The installation can be done online with `install_github` function in the **devtools** package:
```
install.packages("devtools")
install_github("majianthu/copent")
```
The installation can also be completed offline by three steps:
1. Download the depository as .zip file and unzip the file into `copent-master` folder
2. Run the following command and get the archive file `copent_0.1.tar.gz` 
```
R CMD build copent-master
```
3. Install the package from the archive file `copent_0.1.tar.gz` in R
##### Code Example
```
# Example for library "copent"
library(mnormt)
library(copent)
rho = 0.5
sigma = matrix(c(1,rho,rho,1),2,2)
x = rmnorm(500,c(0,0),sigma)
ce1 = copent(x)
```
