Description: The nonparametric methods for estimating copula entropy, transfer entropy, and the statistics for multivariate normality test and two-sample test are implemented. The methods for estimating transfer entropy and the statistics for multivariate normality test and two-sample test are based on the method for estimating copula entropy. The method for change point detection with copula entropy based two-sample test is also implemented.
